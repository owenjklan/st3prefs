## Linux
Note that with the advent of Sublime Text 4's release, that the following path has
been confirmed to work when using Sublime Text 4. The `sublime-text-3` component of the
path doesn't change (so, it doesn't become `sublime-text-4`, at least, not as of June, 2021).

$HOME/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings

## macOS
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings

## Windows 10
%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\Preferences.sublime-settings
